Helped me pass my PI 100 finals. Many thanks to Beranger Natanelic's tutorial on setting up the Google Cloud Vision API.

## Requirements
1. Create or use an existing Project in the Google Cloud Platform to create a service account.
2. Follow the steps [here](https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/setup#sa-create) to enable use of the Vision API. Don't worry about enabling billing, as you can opt for a free trial to use Google Cloud services. You need to create a service account, and then generate a JSON key that can only be downloaded once.
3. Install Vision package (`google-cloud-vision`) for python via `pip`.
